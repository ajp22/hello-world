Programming Journey 

Hi eveyone!

I'm in the middle of a career "mid-life crisis." I've been in the Special Education field for 12 years and looking to get into programming. I've looked into it a couple times throughout my career but different life events prevented me from seriously pursuing my interest in becoming a Software Engineer. Now, I'm at a time in my life where I am able to dedicate larger amounts of time to seriously pursing my interest. I'm diving in and giving it at least 4 hours a day to really absorb as much as I can. 

What I'm really looking for is a rewarding career that challenges me mentally and pays well. In my spare time I workout, read, ski, and hangout with like minded people. I'm excited to get going and see what the next challenges life brings!

Talk soon!
